### Enforce jQuery removal from your application
This library is an efficient way to prevent developers using jQuery to get stuffs done, especially when you are workin as a team and there are lot of jQuery patrons in there. Simply import this library in your application and all the jQuery code will stop working, hence forcing the developers to change the code to vanilla js. For more information about vanilla js please check the documentation here [Vanilla Js](http://vanilla-js.com "Vanilla Js")

### Usage

- Simple download the file into your application folder
- Add the nojquery library into your application like this after the body tag
`		</body>`
`		<script src="/nojquery.js"></script>`
`</html>`

###  Disclaimer
We love jQuery. We do.
